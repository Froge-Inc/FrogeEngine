controls in InputManager.CS :froge:
Up = hold block
down = speedup falling
shoot = snap to bottom
left/right move and left/right rotate is obvious
press any button to pet froge!

By the way; Anything to do with the game directly is inside the GameFolder directory.
Anything outside of it is FrogeEngine; an engine we wrote using monogame to improve it massively (and it's documented!).
Inspired by unity and google results.
We would have wanted to use FrogeEngine as a DLL dependency, but since we weren't sure if it was flawless (and oh lord, it wasn't),
we kept it easily modifiable. Enjoy!

by the way, froge.
